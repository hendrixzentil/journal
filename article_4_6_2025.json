    "<p>Do you know yourself?</p>",
    "<p>Perhaps you know your favorite color, your favorite meal, or your favorite movie, but many people, particularly for those in their budding years, struggle to answer, despite persistently wrestling with that question. I have noticed this, a common pattern among those struggling mentally, through many conversations with friends and strangers alike. In our world of staggeringly fast change, lacking the reassurance of feeling like you belong in your own skin adds another layer of confusion to an already unintelligible existence.</p>",
    "<p>People who describe themselves as \"social chameleons\" may grapple with such existential questions, feeling like actors in their own lives, shifting characters yet questioning which performance, if any, is authentically them. They constantly doubt their decisions, reactions, and even thoughts, creating a dissonance that feels difficult and intimidating to articulate, yet is impossible to ignore.</p>",
    "<p>This lack of self-knowledge, eventually, results in exhaustion, depression, and apathy about one's fate and the world at large. The energy to maintain these questioning states leaves a hollowed out sense of existence behind closed doors. Homesickness, not in the geography sense, but for yourself.</p>",
    "<p>I personally found myself understanding these individuals through many conversations, but I myself never felt internally what they did with such intensity. I was not particularly troubled not knowing myself, but I realized its importance when I encountered a perspective that reframed my understanding of self-knowledge entirely.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, knowing oneself isn't the color of your eyes, skin, hair, or anything physical, tangible. Self-knowledge is authenticity, feeling free from the torment of acting as a character—a replacement for seemingly nothing.</p>",
    "<img src=\"/images/article_4_6_2025_2.jpg\" alt=\"Melancholy, Albert Gyorgy (2012)\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\">",
    "<p>Reader, what is your favorite color? Your favorite food? Truly, answer, please.</p>",
    "<p>Chances are, you answered these questions relatively quickly. However, will your answers stand the test of time? There is no way to have absolute certainty, even if you answered confidently. Perhaps the color of your future love's eyes will supersede your love for your current favorite, and you will experience a life changing meal at a street vendor of a small town. Therefore, you can never be fully sure, but it is reasonable to have confidence in your answers.</p>",
    "<p>Reader, what about questions about you, that even you don't have the answer for? For instance:</p>",
    "<p>When you make a decision, can you trace the exact moment you actually decided, or does it seem to emerge from somewhere you can't quite access?</p>",
    "<p>What would you still care about if no one else in the world knew or cared about it?</p>",
    "<p>When has your body responded emotionally to something before your conscious mind recognized?</p>",
    "<p>Fortunately, these types of questions, unanswerable even with intense retrospection, can instead be answered with life experimentation. For example, the only way to determine your favorite food is by exploring the world's cuisine, and the only way to find your favorite movie is to watch every film.</p>",
    "<p>How deeply do you wish to understand yourself? Those who suffer from not knowing themselves clearly have a deep yearning for self-discovery, while others, like myself, seem relatively unbothered by these same existential questions. Our differing reactions suggest that the desire for self-knowledge itself varies greatly.</p>",
    "<p>What fabrics feel best against your skin? What music makes your heart soar? Which activities make you lose track of time? What environments help you feel most at peace? Which people bring out your best self? What ethical principles would you never compromise, even under pressure?</p>",
    "<p>If you can't answer these questions, I implore you - find out! Continuously explore new questions about yourself. You can answer questions both large and especially small. Take the bus instead of the train, jump in that puddle, tell that person you love them, sit in a new seat in class, try unfamiliar foods. Then, allow your body and mind to offer emotions in response, helping you discern what resonates.</p>",
    "<p>However, this alone does not complete the problem. Through experimentation, you come to know the external you—your tangible preferences and characteristics, which still doesn't answer the question of who you really are at your core.</p>",
    "<p>Knowing these tangibles are simply knowledge of how you react to stimuli - for example, knowing that you react warmly to your favorite movie, or how you would react in a tough situation. Something lies deeper, an entity that animates your body. I call this entity the \"self-self\" - the puppeteer behind the curtain of your body. The \"self\" - your tangibles - are what others perceive, and what you perceive of yourself. The external world is a world of \"selves\", but your conscious mind and spirit belong to the \"self-self.\" Thus, the \"self-self\", and trying to understand it, inherently, is the root question that often leads to existential distress.</p>",
    "<p>You don't really choose what your favorite color is—it simply is. You might decide to prefer blue over purple, but if your experiences have made purple your honest favorite, forcing this change will likely lead to inner conflict. You cannot artificially change yourself without experiencing some form of disconnection, just like upholding the act of a character causes eventual distress.</p>",
    "<p>The \"self-self\" is the observer of the self—the true you. It has no inherent qualities: no feelings, no body, no mind, no eyes. Yet it processes your experiences and imbues them with meaning. The \"self-self\" encompasses your inquisitiveness, curiosity, emotional capacity, rationality—it is the steward of your being. Understanding the \"self-self\" through rigorous scientific inquiry is impossible; there is nothing tangible to observe.</p>",
    "<img src=\"/images/article_4_6_2025_3.jpg\" alt=\"Reddit, source unknown\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\">",
    "<p>Thus, you are a split being, tied together, the \"self\" and the \"self-self\". Inherently, when two beings coexist in such intimate proximity for the length of a lifetime, a relationship must form. This relationship, just as you have the freedom to create relationships with others, is a complete blank slate, since you, the \"self-self\", get to interact and learn about the external self just as you would a friend, lover, or relative. At some point, you probably asked a friend what their favorite color is, and they answered - and the reverse probably happened too, you had to come up with a genuine answer. This is the kind of relationship you have with yourself, too, except in this case, you embody both sides of the exchange—posing questions to a 'you' that somehow feels separate, yet receiving answers from a place that feels intimately yours.</p>",
    "<p>While this self-relationship can be confusing and even intimidating, consider it no different than one with a close friend. Most people label the self-relationship but with an added layer, such as self-love or self-hate. However, you can self-love the same exact way you love someone else, and you can self-hate the same way you hate someone else, and so on.</p>",
    "<p>Self-love is not narcissism or self-absorption. Rather, it's treating yourself with the same patience, forgiveness, and understanding you would offer a beloved friend. It's recognizing that the journey of self-discovery is not a linear path with a clear destination but a lifelong relationship with yourself.</p>",
    "<p>When you approach your external self with love, you create space for authentic exploration. Consider how you relate to someone you deeply care for: you're patient with their flaws, you forgive their mistakes, you celebrate their growth. This is the attitude that makes self-discovery possible—not harsh judgment or rigid expectations.</p>",
    "<p>Self-love acknowledges that your preferences and characteristics will change. The person who loved spicy food at twenty may prefer milder flavors at forty. The introvert who dreaded parties might discover joy in certain social settings later in life. Self-love allows you to embrace these changes without an identity crisis, recognizing that evolution is not betrayal of your essence but expression of it. Most importantly, self-love serves as the mediator between your external self and your observing self-self. It creates a relationship of curiosity rather than criticism. Just as you might be fascinated by the unfolding personality of a child you love, self-love allows you to witness your own development with wonder rather than anxiety.</p>",
    "<img src=\"/images/article_4_6_2025_4.jpg\" alt=\"@candacedyar, Instagram\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\">",
    "<p>This fascination with the way your own life unfolds is further bolstered by keen awareness. Self-change depends on a delicate balance: being fully present in moments as they unfold, then stepping back to reflect on them afterward. When you're caught in self-judgment, you can neither truly experience the present moment nor objectively reflect on it later. But when self-love guides this process, you can immerse yourself in experiences without self-consciousness, then later contemplate them with gentle curiosity. This rhythmic dance between immersion and reflection gradually deepens your self-understanding. Like a photographer who must both experience a scene and later develop the film, your awareness becomes richer when you can both live your moments fully and process them thoughtfully—a capacity that grows stronger through the practice of self-love.</p>",
    "<p>The journey to know yourself isn't about forcing revelation or demanding immediate clarity. It's about establishing that loving dialogue between your external self and your observing self-self—a conversation characterized by the same patience, forgiveness, and celebration you would offer a dear friend. With self-love as the mediator, this dialogue becomes not an interrogation but an ongoing, life-affirming conversation. So if you find yourself struggling with questions of identity, by all means, experiment with life and discover your preferences. But remember that in loving yourself as you would a cherished other, you might just bridge the gap between who you appear to be and who you truly are.</p>"
