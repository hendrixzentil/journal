      "<p>Recently on April 9, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order modifying his recently announced tariff strategy in response to escalating trade tensions with China. The order makes two significant changes:</p>",
      
      "<p>Firstly, it dramatically increases tariffs on Chinese imports from 84% to 125%, directly responding to China's announcement of 84% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Secondly, it temporarily suspends the country-specific tariffs for all other trading partners listed in the original April 2nd order for 90 days, replacing them with a uniform 10% tariff.</p>",
      
      "<p>This two-pronged approach appears designed to isolate China while offering potential relief to trading partners who have approached the U.S. to address trade reciprocity concerns. The order also increases duties on postal shipments to prevent circumvention of these measures through small package imports.</p>",
      
      "<p>Following the sudden news, the S&P 500 jumped a monumental 9.52% but slumped -4.81% by market close the next day, April 10th, showing signs of wavering confidence in the administration's trade strategy and its potential medium-term economic impacts.</p>",
      
      "<p>Trump himself acknowledges that the stock market will recess in light of his recent legislative initiatives, stating \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\" in a recent interview with CNN. In the same interview, he also mentions \"I don't want anything to go down\" in reference to the markets, implying that he hopes to minimize economic downturn amid this trade war. This raises the question: what will he do in the future, and how will the market react? Specifically, how will the markets react leading up to July 8, the end of the 90-day tariff halt?</p>",
      
      "<p>Firstly, the obviousâ€“the future is especially uncertain and therefore the markets will be volatile. There is no promise that the tariff values proposed on April 2nd will be the same on July 8th. Secondly, any signs of successful trade negotiations with major trading partners could create positive momentum, as investors would interpret progress as a sign that the 10% baseline might be reduced or eliminated for cooperative countries. Conversely, if few agreements materialize, markets may price in a risk that tariffs become permanent or increase.</p>",
      
      "<p>This is especially important regarding the China situation. If the 125% tariffs on Chinese goods cause significant economic pain for either country, leading to negotiation signals, markets might rally on hopes of de-escalation. However, further retaliatory measures from China could trigger additional market declines.</p>",
      
      "<p>Finally, economic data will be closely watched. If early indicators show minimal inflation impact from the tariffs or suggest that domestic manufacturing is benefiting, markets might respond positively. However, signs of supply chain disruption, rising consumer prices, or slowing growth could trigger significant selloffs.</p>",
      
      "<p>Overall, the odds seem to be working in favor of the bear for the short-to-mid term. Expect high volatility especially when news from the White House comes out. Investors would be wise to prepare for sudden market swings by diversifying portfolios, potentially increasing cash positions, and carefully monitoring developments in trade negotiations with both China and other major trading partners.</p>",
      
      "<p>While Trump's \"medicine\" metaphor suggests he's prepared to accept short-term market pain, the administration will likely face increasing pressure to demonstrate tangible benefits from this trade strategy if market declines persist through the 90-day window. By early July, market sentiment will heavily depend on whether the administration signals an extension of the temporary measures, a return to the original tariff structure, or a new approach based on negotiation outcomes.</p>"
